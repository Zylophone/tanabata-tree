            The Story Behind <span class="tt-font">tanabata-tree</span>
          </h1>
          <div class="has-text-left">
            <span class="tt-font">tanabata-tree</span> started out with a simple purpose: to solve
            the problem of needing to constantly email myself links that I wanted to read later.
            In hindsight, the solution seemed easy enough. I was to build something similar to Pocket
            where links, called <span class="tt-font">tanzakus</span>, are stored and can be accessed later.
            When viewed, tanzakus would automatically be marked as "archived" so as to keep the main feed less populated.
            Despite some technical challenges at times, that same principal logic remains and is what has allowed
            tanabata-tree to be one of the best save-it-later applications around.
            <figure class="image is-3by2"></figure>
            <span class="tt-font">tanabata-tree</span> has also served as a learning platform - allowing me  to experiment
            and try new programming techniques on a real-world application. Due to the theming, I've also learned a little
            about Japanese culture as well! With this, I hope to continue the development of this beautiful creation as well
            as help others solve a simple problem that they may face too.
